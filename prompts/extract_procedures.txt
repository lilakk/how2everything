You will be looking at a document from a web corpora. Your goal is to extract a well-defined sequential process containing a list of at least three executable steps. A valid process should fulfill all of the following requirements:

1. Sequential: the steps should follow a sequential order, where later steps depend on the completion of previous steps.
2. Imperative and atomic: express each step as a single action. Add adjectives or adverbs only when they supply essential precision (e.g., "coarsely grind beans" vs. simply "grind beans").
3. Concrete: each step should specify what to do, not why.

In order to satisfy these requirements, the steps you extract may differ from how they are originally presented in the document. If there exists such a valid process, you should also extract the goal of this process, which should:

1. Clearly state the outcome the process is meant to achieve.
2. Contain any essential context or constraints needed to understand or bound that outcome.

Output your response in JSON format following this convention:

{{
    "has_valid_process": <boolean>,  // true or false
    "goal": <string>,  // can be an empty string if there is no valid process
    "steps": <string[]>  // can be an empty list if there is no valid process
}}

If it is impossible to extract a valid process from the given document, simply set "has_valid_process" to false, and leave "goal" and "steps" empty.
