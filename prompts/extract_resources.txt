Below is a goal and a corresponding list of steps to achieve that goal.

Goal:
{goal}

Steps:
{steps}

Your task is to extract and return a deduplicated list of every distinct resource—tool, ingredient, piece of equipment, location, entity, etc.—explicitly mentioned in the steps only. Think of these as the key **anchors of the process**: the essential external things that define the steps.

Guidelines:
1. List each resource only once.
2. Include only primary, external resources. Skip anything produced along the way (intermediate creations).
3. Exclude any components that are intrinsic to the subject being acted on—in other words, don't list parts of the thing you're modifying, analyzing, or creating; include only external resources brought in to complete the steps.
4. Ignore verbs, non‑identifying adjectives, measurements, and generic or vague terms like "parts," "item," "object," "surface," or pronouns.

Please return your response in the following JSON format:

{{
    "resources": <string[]>
}}
