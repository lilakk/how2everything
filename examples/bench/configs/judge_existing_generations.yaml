## Judge a generations.jsonl that lives outside of your out_root.
##
## Use this when the generations file was produced by someone else or lives
## in a different directory. If you just want to re-judge your own run with
## a different judge, simply change `evaluator:` in your original config and
## re-run — no `paths.generations` needed.
